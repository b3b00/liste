features documentation are defined in documentation/feature/<NAME_OF_THE_FEATURE>
feature folders will contains :
 - description.md : the feature description, defined by me.
 - plan.md : the implementation plan. copilot field. the plan should not get too much implementation details but keep to technical or functional constraints.
 - implementation.md : by copilot, will contains implementation details, specifically if important technical reword is needed

copilot must not starts its  implementation without a explicit order after planning step so I could rview and modify plan if needed
