a list has an owner. only the user can modify it. another user can modify but this will :
  1. send a notification to owner.
  2. owner accept or not the update
  3. slave used receive a notification stating if mod is accepted or not.
This will solve conflicts resolution in a quite harsh way.

users identification is a pain point. we would prefer avoir identification/authentification (as OAuth for instance)
